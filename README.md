# WorldWise project

<p>This application is an educational project created as part of a course offered by Jonas Schmedtmann. WorldWise is a fake React application designed to help users track the cities and countries they have visited. In the app, you need to log in using a fake user account. You can add and delete cities on the map, leave comments, get your position and access additional information about cities from Wikipedia. The application utilizes cities.json as the backend API. </p>
